# All stuff for HK 201 includes:
1. Database
2. Web programming (using HTML, CSS, JS and PHP)
3. PPL (Assignment 1 and 2 are pretty good, but I'm not sure about assignment 3. I dropped assignment 4 because of laziness). I didn't make it :( . Let me try that again
4. Computer Network (My knowledge of this course is not good)
